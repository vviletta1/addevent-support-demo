AddEvent Customer Support Demo
A fully responsive front-end demo showcasing how I would contribute as a Customer Support Representative at AddEvent. This project highlights my ability to understand product functionality, assist users, and communicate clearly through a simulated Help Center, internal support dashboard, and AI-assisted chatbot review system.

Features

Help Center Page: Clear, human-written FAQs tailored for AddEvent's use cases (API, calendar sync, implementation support).
Ticket Dashboard: Simulated internal tool showing how support tickets could be tracked and triaged.
Calendar Sync Demo: Front-end example of how AddEvent’s calendar API might be supported in customer onboarding or documentation.
Chatbot Review Panel: Interface to monitor AI chatbot conversations, showing how I’d identify gaps and provide human intervention.
Clean, Accessible UI: Designed for clarity and support team workflows, while being easy to expand or integrate with a real backend.

Purpose

Built as part of a creative application for AddEvent’s Customer Support role. I wanted to go beyond the resume to show how I think, communicate, and work in customer service—especially in fast-growing, tech-savvy environments. As an AI & Robotics student with 11+ years of support experience, this merges both worlds: people-first support and technical awareness.
