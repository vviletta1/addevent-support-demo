    <h1>🤖 Chatbot Quality Review Log</h1>
    <p>This log highlights examples where a chatbot handling developer support failed to provide helpful responses. Each entry includes the original user message, the bot's reply, the issue identified, and a suggested fix.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>User Message</th>
          <th>Bot Response</th>
          <th>Issue</th>
          <th>Suggested Fix</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>“How can I send reminders with the API?”</td>
          <td>“Please check your email settings in your account.”</td>
          <td>Bot misunderstood – user was asking about automation, not settings.</td>
          <td>Update chatbot to recognize "reminders" as an API topic and suggest scheduling email reminders via the API.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>“How do I let users RSVP to events?”</td>
          <td>“Our system supports multiple time zones.”</td>
          <td>Irrelevant response – doesn't address RSVP.</td>
          <td>Add conditional logic to suggest event registration forms or RSVP API features when “RSVP” is mentioned.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>“Where do I put the script for the add-to-calendar button?”</td>
          <td>“You can style your button with CSS.”</td>
          <td>Bot skipped the key question – user needed installation help, not styling.</td>
          <td>Prioritize including the base script tag and setup guide when user asks about setup.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>“Can I embed a calendar in my app?”</td>
          <td>“We help users add events to their personal calendars.”</td>
          <td>Partial match – didn’t address the app integration directly.</td>
          <td>Clarify that developers can use iFrame or widget embed and provide link to widget setup doc.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
